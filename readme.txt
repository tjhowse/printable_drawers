This is a design for a 3D printable set of drawers for organising small bits and pieces, such as electronics components. The design is parametric, so you can alter the size of cell of the grid, and you can also easily produce drawers that are a number of grid units high or wide.

You'll need to print two matching frame_face pieces per cell you want. You'll also need to print two posts for every four-way intersection of cell corners, one for every two-way intersection of cell corners, such as on the edges of the stack, and one edge_post for every corner of the stack (usually 4). For example, for a simple 3x2 design as shown in my photo, you'll need ten post pieces, and four edge_post pieces, twelve frame_face pieces, and six drawer pieces.  

To assemble the drawers, lay half of the frame_face pieces down in your desired pattern. Now insert all of the post pieces. I recommend you use a piece of wood or a small hammer to get them seated properly. The SCAD file has an assembled() module that shows how the pieces fit. Once you've got all the posts in place you should not have any fins protruding from the edges of the drawers, and every drawer should have two rails supporting the lower left and right edges. Once all the posts are installed, lay the rest of the frame_face pieces on top and fit them onto the posts in the same orientation as the first set. Give each intersection a good tap down, turn it upright and insert your drawers. Done!
